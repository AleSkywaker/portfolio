# Some History

- I was born in São Paulo, Brazil — land of samba, football, and feijoada.
- When I was 6, my parents decided Spain had better tapas, so we packed up and moved.
- I grew up and studied in Madrid until I turned 20, then took a leap of faith and moved to London to start a new life — no plan, no safety net, just good vibes and bad weather.
- Eventually, I returned to Madrid and joined a big company — yes, one of those with amazing people and excellent coffee.
- Then came another plot twist: I moved to Valencia to start over once again... and that’s where I’m still writing my story.
